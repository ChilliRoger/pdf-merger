## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

The application is configured for Vercel deployment using the `vercel.json` configuration file:

```json
{
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
      {
        "src": "api/app.py",
        "use": "@vercel/python"
      }
    ],
    "routes": [
      {
        "src": "/(.*)",
        "dest": "api/app.py"
      }
    ]
}
```

To deploy on Vercel:

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts** to configure your deployment

## 🔧 Technical Details

### File Handling

- **Merging**: Uploaded files stored in `/tmp/uploads`, merged files in `/tmp/merged`
- **Editing**: Session-based storage in `/tmp/edit_sessions` with unique session IDs
- **Auto Cleanup**: All uploaded files are automatically deleted after processing
- **Unique Filenames**: UUID-based naming prevents conflicts when uploading duplicate files

### PDF Processing

- **Merging**: Uses PyPDF2's `PdfMerger` and `PdfWriter` for efficient combining
- **Page Extraction**: PyPDF2's `PdfReader` for page-level manipulation
- **Image Rendering**: PyMuPDF (fitz) renders PDF pages as JPEG thumbnails
- **Optimization**: 1.0x zoom and 75% JPEG quality for fast loading in serverless environments

### Security & Performance

- **File Validation**: Only PDF files accepted (`accept="application/pdf"`)
- **Session Isolation**: Each editing session has a unique ID
- **No Persistent Storage**: Files deleted immediately after use
- **Progressive Loading**: Page images load sequentially to avoid server overload
- **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanism for failed page loads
- **Serverless Ready**: Optimized for Vercel's serverless functions

### Browser Features

- **Modern CSS**: Clean, professional design without gradients
- **Responsive Grid**: Adapts to any screen size
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in effects and hover transitions
- **Custom Scrollbars**: Styled scrollbars for better UX
- **Modal System**: Help popup with keyboard shortcuts (ESC to close)
- **Lazy Loading**: Progressive image loading for better performance

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **File Count**: Maximum 50 PDFs can be merged at once
- **File Size**: Limited by server/hosting configuration (Vercel has 50MB limit)
- **Processing Time**: Large PDFs may take longer to process in serverless environments
- **Page Previews**: Generated on-demand, may take time for PDFs with many pages
- **No Password Support**: Cannot process password-protected PDFs
- **Temporary Storage**: Files are not permanently stored, download immediately
- **No Encryption**: Edited/merged PDFs are not encrypted

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

Potential features for future development:
- Password-protected PDF support
- Page rotation functionality
- Page reordering (drag and drop)
- PDF compression options
- Watermark addition
- PDF to image conversion
- Batch processing
- Cloud storage integration
